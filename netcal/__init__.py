API Reference
=============
This is the detailled API reference for the confidence calibration framework. This framework can be used to
obtain well-calibrated confidence estimates from biased estimators like Neural Networks.
The API reference contains a detailled description of all available methods and their parameters. For
miscellaneous examples on how to use these methods, see readme below.

   presentation


Each calibration method must inherit the base class :class:`AbstractCalibration`. If you want to write your own method and
include into the framework, include this class as the base class.
