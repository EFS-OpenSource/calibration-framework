API Reference of net:cal
========================
This is the detailed API reference for the net:cal calibration framework. This library can be used to
obtain well-calibrated confidence or uncertainty estimates from biased estimators such as neural networks.
The API reference contains a detailed description of all available methods and their parameters. For
miscellaneous examples on how to use these methods, see readme below.

Available packages
------------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _autosummary

   binning
   scaling
   regularization
   metrics
   presentation
   regression


Each calibration method must inherit the base class :class:`AbstractCalibration`. If you want to write your own method and
include into the framework, include this class as the base class.
