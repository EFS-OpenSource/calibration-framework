class ECE(_Miscalibration):
    """
    Expected Calibration Error (ECE).
    This metric is used on classification [1]_ or as Detection Expected Calibration Error on object
    detection tasks [2]_. This metrics measures the expected difference between accuracy and confidence by grouping
    all samples (size :math:`N`) into :math:`K` bins
    and calculating

    .. math::

       ECE = \\sum_{i=1}^K \\frac{|B_i|}{N} |\\text{acc}_i - \\text{conf}_i| ,

    where :math:`\\text{acc}_i` and :math:`\\text{conf}_i` denote the accuracy and average confidence in the i-th bin
    and :math:`|B_i|` denote the number of samples in bin :math:`B_i`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bins : int or iterable, default: 10
        Number of bins used by the Histogram Binning.
        On detection mode: if int, use same amount of bins for each dimension (nx1 = nx2 = ... = bins).
        If iterable, use different amount of bins for each dimension (nx1, nx2, ... = bins).
    detection : bool, default: False
        If False, the input array 'X' is treated as multi-class confidence input (softmax)
        with shape (n_samples, [n_classes]).
        If True, the input array 'X' is treated as a box predictions with several box features (at least
        box confidence must be present) with shape (n_samples, [n_box_features]).

        Measure calibration by given predictions with confidence and the according ground truth.
        Assume binary predictions with y=1.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : np.ndarray, shape=(n_samples, [n_classes]) or (n_samples, [n_box_features])
            NumPy array with confidence values for each prediction on classification with shapes
            1-D for binary classification, 2-D for multi class (softmax).
            On detection, this array must have 2 dimensions with number of additional box features in last dim.
        y : np.ndarray, shape=(n_samples, [n_classes])
            NumPy array with ground truth labels.
            Either as label vector (1-D) or as one-hot encoded ground truth array (2-D).
        return_map: bool, optional, default: False
            If True, return map with miscalibration metric separated into all remaining dimension bins.
        return_num_samples : bool, optional, default: False
            If True, also return the number of samples in each bin.

        Returns
        -------
        float or tuple of (float, np.ndarray) or tuple of (float, np.ndarray, np.ndarray)
            Always returns miscalibration metric.
            If 'return_map' is False, return ECE only (or num_samples map).
            If 'return_map' is True, return tuple with ECE and map over all bins.
            If 'return_num_samples' is False, ECE only (or ECE map).
            If 'return_num_samples' is True, return tuple with ECE and number of samples in each bin.
