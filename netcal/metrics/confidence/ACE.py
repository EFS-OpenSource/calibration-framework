class ACE(_Miscalibration):
    """
    Average Calibration Error (ACE) for classification and Detection Average Calibration Error (D-ACE) for
    object detection or segmentation.
    This metric is used on classification [1]_ or as Detection Average Calibration Error (D-ACE)
    [2]_ on object detection tasks. This metrics measures the average difference between accuracy and confidence by
    grouping all samples into :math:`B` bins and calculating

    .. math::

       ACE = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^B |\\text{acc}(b) - \\text{conf}(b)| ,

    where :math:`\\text{acc}(b)` and :math:`\\text{conf}(b)` denote the accuracy and average confidence in the b-th bin.
    The main difference to :class:`netcal.regression.confidence.ECE` is that each bin is weighted equally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bins : int or iterable, default: 10
        Number of bins used by the ACE.
        On detection mode: if int, use same amount of bins for each dimension (nx1 = nx2 = ... = bins).
        If iterable, use different amount of bins for each dimension (nx1, nx2, ... = bins).
    equal_intervals : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, the bins have the same width. If False, the bins are splitted to equalize
        the number of samples in each bin.
    detection : bool, default: False
        If False, the input array 'X' is treated as multi-class confidence input (softmax)
        with shape (n_samples, [n_classes]).
        If True, the input array 'X' is treated as a box predictions with several box features (at least
        box confidence must be present) with shape (n_samples, [n_box_features]).
    sample_threshold : int, optional, default: 1
        Bins with an amount of samples below this threshold are not included into the miscalibration metrics.

        Measure calibration by given predictions with confidence and the according ground truth.
        Assume binary predictions with y=1.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : iterable of np.ndarray, or np.ndarray of shape=([n_bayes], n_samples, [n_classes/n_box_features])
            NumPy array with confidence values for each prediction on classification with shapes
            1-D for binary classification, 2-D for multi class (softmax).
            If 3-D, interpret first dimension as samples from an Bayesian estimator with mulitple data points
            for a single sample (e.g. variational inference or MC dropout samples).
            If this is an iterable over multiple instances of np.ndarray and parameter batched=True,
            interpret this parameter as multiple predictions that should be averaged.
            On detection, this array must have 2 dimensions with number of additional box features in last dim.
        y : iterable of np.ndarray with same length as X or np.ndarray of shape=([n_bayes], n_samples, [n_classes])
            NumPy array with ground truth labels.
            Either as label vector (1-D) or as one-hot encoded ground truth array (2-D).
            If 3-D, interpret first dimension as samples from an Bayesian estimator with mulitple data points
            for a single sample (e.g. variational inference or MC dropout samples).
            If iterable over multiple instances of np.ndarray and parameter batched=True,
            interpret this parameter as multiple predictions that should be averaged.
        batched : bool, optional, default: False
            Multiple predictions can be evaluated at once (e.g. cross-validation examinations) using batched-mode.
            All predictions given by X and y are separately evaluated and their results are averaged afterwards
            for visualization.
        uncertainty : str, optional, default: False
            Define uncertainty handling if input X has been sampled e.g. by Monte-Carlo dropout or similar methods
            that output an ensemble of predictions per sample. Choose one of the following options:
            - flatten:  treat everything as a separate prediction - this option will yield into a slightly better
                        calibration performance but without the visualization of a prediction interval.
            - mean:     compute Monte-Carlo integration to obtain a simple confidence estimate for a sample
                        (mean) with a standard deviation that is visualized.
        return_map: bool, optional, default: False
            If True, return map with miscalibration metric separated into all remaining dimension bins.
        return_num_samples : bool, optional, default: False
            If True, also return the number of samples in each bin.
        return_uncertainty_map : bool, optional, default: False
            If True, also return the average deviation of the confidence within each bin.

        Returns
        -------
        float or tuple of (float, np.ndarray, [np.ndarray, [np.ndarray]])
            Always returns Average Calibration Error.
            If 'return_map' is True, return tuple and append miscalibration map over all bins.
            If 'return_num_samples' is True, return tuple and append the number of samples in each bin (excluding confidence dimension).
            If 'return_uncertainty' is True, return tuple and append the average standard deviation of confidence within each bin (excluding confidence dimension).
