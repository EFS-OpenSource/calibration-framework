class ReliabilityQCE(object):
    """
    Visualizes the Conditional Quantile Calibration Error (C-QCE) in the scope of regression calibration as a bar chart
    for probabilistic regression models.
    See :class:`netcal.metrics.regression.QCE` for a detailed documentation of the C-QCE [1]_.
    This method is able to visualize the C-QCE in terms of multiple univariate distributions if the input is given
    as multiple independent Gaussians.
    This method is also able to visualize the multivariate C-QCE for a multivariate Gaussian if the input is given
    with covariance matrices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bins : int or iterable, default: 10
        Number of bins used by the C-QCE binning.
        If iterable, use different amount of bins for each dimension (nx1, nx2, ... = bins).

        Visualizes the C-QCE as a bar chart either for multiple univariate data (if standard deviations are given as
        input) or for a joint multivariate distribution (if covariance matrices are given as input).
        See parameter "kind" for a detailed description of the input format.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : np.ndarray of shape (r, n, [d]) or (t, n, [d]), or Tuple of two np.ndarray, each of shape (n, [d])
            Input data obtained by a model that performs inference with uncertainty.
            See parameter "kind" for input format descriptions.
        y : np.ndarray of shape (n, [d])
            Target scores for each prediction estimate in X.
        q : np.ndarray of shape (q,)
            Quantile scores in [0, 1] of size q to compute the x-valued quantile boundaries for.
        kind : str, either "meanstd" or "cumulative"
            Specify the kind of the input data. Might be one of:
            - meanstd: if X is tuple of two NumPy arrays with shape (n, [d]) and (n, [d, [d]]), this method asserts the
                       first array as mean and the second one as the according stddev predictions for d dimensions.
                       If the second NumPy array has shape (n, d, d), this method asserts covariance matrices as input
                       for each sample. In this case, the NLL is calculated for multivariate distributions.
                       If X is single NumPy array of shape (r, n), this methods asserts predictions obtained by a stochastic
                       inference model (e.g. network using MC dropout) with n samples and r stochastic forward passes. In this
                       case, the mean and stddev is computed automatically.
            - cumulative: assert X as tuple of two NumPy arrays of shape (t, n, [d]) with t points on the cumulative
                          for sample n (and optionally d dimensions).
        range_ : list of length d with tuples (lower_bound: float, upper_bound: float)
            List of tuples that define the binning range of the standard deviation for each dimension separately.
            For example, if input data is given with only a few samples having high standard deviations,
            this might distort the calculations as the binning scheme commonly takes the (min, max) as the range
            for the binning, yielding a high amount of empty bins.
        filename : str, optional, default: None
            Optional filename to save the plotted figure.
        tikz : bool, optional, default: False
            If True, use 'tikzplotlib' package to return tikz-code for Latex rather than a Matplotlib figure.
        title_suffix : str, optional, default: None
            Suffix for plot title.
        **save_args : args
            Additional arguments passed to 'matplotlib.pyplot.Figure.savefig' function if 'tikz' is False.
            If 'tikz' is True, the argument are passed to 'tikzplotlib.get_tikz_code' function.

        Returns
        -------
        matplotlib.pyplot.Figure if 'tikz' is False else str with tikz code.
            Visualization of the C-QCE either as Matplotlib figure or as string with tikz code.
