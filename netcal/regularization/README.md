# Regularization Methods for Confidence Calibration

Regularization methods which are applied during model training. These methods should achieve a
confidence calibration during model training. For example, the Confidence Penalty
penalizes confident predictions and prohibits over-confident estimates.
Use the functions to obtain the regularization and callback instances with prebuild parameters.
