class TemperatureScaling(LogisticCalibration):
    """
    Perform Temperature scaling to logits of NN. This method is originally proposed by [1]_.
    The calibrated probability :math:`\\hat{q}` is computed by

    .. math::

       \\hat{q} = \\sigma_{\\text{SM}} (z / T)

    with :math:`\\sigma_{\\text{SM}}` as the softmax operator (or the sigmoid alternatively),
    :math:`z` as the logits and :math:`T` as the temperature estimated by logistic regression.
    This leds to calibrated confidence estimates.
    This methods can also be applied on object detection tasks with an additional regression output [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    detection : bool, default: False
        If False, the input array 'X' is treated as multi-class confidence input (softmax)
        with shape (n_samples, [n_classes]).
        If True, the input array 'X' is treated as a box predictions with several box features (at least
        box confidence must be present) with shape (n_samples, [n_box_features]).
    independent_probabilities : bool, optional, default: False
        Boolean for multi class probabilities.
        If set to True, the probability estimates for each
        class are treated as independent of each other (sigmoid).
