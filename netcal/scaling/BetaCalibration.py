class BetaCalibration(AbstractCalibration):
    """
    On classification, apply the beta calibration method to obtain a calibration mapping. The original method was
    proposed by [1]_.
    For the multiclass case, we extended this method to work with multinomial logistic regression instead of a
    one vs. all calibration mapping.
    On detection mode, this calibration method uses multiple independent Beta distributions to obtain a
    calibration mapping by means of the confidence as well as additional features [2]_. This calibration scheme
    assumes independence between all variables.

    It is necessary to provide all data in input parameter ``X`` as an NumPy array of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``,
    whereas the confidence must be the first feature given in the input array. The ground-truth samples ``y``
    must be an array of shape ``(n_samples,)`` consisting of binary labels :math:`y \\in \\{0, 1\\}`. Those
    labels indicate if the according sample has matched a ground truth box :math:`\\text{m}=1` or is a false
    prediction :math:`\\text{m}=0`.

    **Mathematical background:** For confidence calibration in classification tasks, a
    confidence mapping :math:`g` is applied on top of a miscalibrated scoring classifier :math:`\\hat{p} = h(x)` to
    deliver a calibrated confidence score :math:`\\hat{q} = g(h(x))`.

    For detection calibration, we can also use the additional box regression output which we denote as
    :math:`\\hat{r} \\in [0, 1]^J` with :math:`J` as the number of dimensions used for the box encoding (e.g.
    :math:`J=4` for x position, y position, width and height).
    Therefore, the calibration map is not only a function of the confidence score, but also of :math:`\\hat{r}`.
    To define a general calibration map for binary problems, we use the logistic function and the combined
    input :math:`s = (\\hat{p}, \\hat{r})` of size K by

    .. math::

       g(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z(s))} ,

    According to [1]_, we can interpret the logit :math:`z` as the logarithm of the posterior odds

    .. math::

       z(s) = \\log \\frac{f(\\text{m}=1 | s)}{f(\\text{m}=0 | s)} \\approx
       \\log \\frac{f(s | \\text{m}=1)}{f(s | \\text{m}=1)} = \\ell r(s)

    If we assume independence of all variables given in :math:`s`, we can use multiple univariate probability
    density distributions to obtain a calibration mapping. Using multiple beta distributions (one for each variable
    and one for each case :math:`\\text{m}=1` and :math:`\\text{m}=0`), the log-likelihood ratio can be
    expressed as

    .. math::
       \\ell r(s) = \\sum^K_{k=1} \\log \\Bigg(\\frac{\\text{Beta}(s_k | \\alpha^+_k, \\beta^+_k)}
                                                     {\\text{Beta}(s_k | \\alpha^-_k, \\beta^-_k)}\\Bigg)

    with the beta distribution :math:`\\text{Beta}(s_k|\\alpha, \\beta)`. The shape parameters
    for :math:`\\text{m}=1` and :math:`\\text{m}=0` are denoted by :math:`\\alpha_k^+, \\beta_k^+` and
    :math:`\\alpha_k^-, \\beta_k^-`, respectively. We can reparametrize this expression by using

    .. math::
       \\ell r(s) = c + \\sum^K_{k=1} a_k \\log(s_k) - b_k \\log(1-s_k) ,

    where the distribution parameters are summarized by :math:`a_k=\\alpha_k^+-\\alpha_k^-`,
    :math:`b_k=\\beta_k^--\\beta_k^+` and
    :math:`c=\\sum_k \\log B(\\alpha_k^-, \\beta_k^-) - \\log B(\\alpha_k^+, \\beta_k^+)`.
    We utilize standard optimization methods to determine the calibration mapping :math:`g(s)`.
